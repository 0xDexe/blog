# Malware Detection System

Published research paper in IEEE 2022 on Deep Learning based Residual Attention Network for Malware Detection at the International Conference on Intelligent Computing and Control Systems.

## Research Contribution

Designed and developed a novel Residual Attention Network model with an extended quadratic kernel with soft-attention mechanism to detect executable malware files, achieving 96.25% accuracy on testing data.

## Novel Architecture

The model combines:

1. **Residual Connections**: Enable training of very deep networks
2. **Soft-Attention Mechanism**: Focus on relevant features for malware detection
3. **Extended Quadratic Kernel**: Capture complex non-linear patterns
4. **Multi-scale Feature Extraction**: Detect malware at different granularities

## Performance Metrics

- **Accuracy**: 96.25% on testing dataset
- **Precision**: 95.8%
- **Recall**: 96.7%
- **F1-Score**: 96.2%

## Publication
